Kreditpro post-Interview assignment

-Friday - Sunday downloaded softwares, setup the environment, research on CORS & Captcha implementation
-Sunday - onwards, development stage
-Got stuck on CORS issues, I've tried my best within this timespan (spent 4+hours resolving this issue), and decided to proceed to finish the other features.
-This issue is possibly caused by my old version of laravel (5.x) and php (7.x). I didn't have enough time to upgrade Laravel and refactor the code.
