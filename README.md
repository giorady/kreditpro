Kreditpro post-Interview assignment

1. Friday - Sunday downloaded softwares, setup the environment, research on CORS & Captcha implementation
2. Sunday - onwards, development stage
3. Got stuck on CORS issues, I've tried my best within this timespan (spent 4+hours resolving CORS issue), and decided to proceed to finish the other features (Captcha & Upload file).
4. This issue might be caused by my old version of laravel (5.x) and php (7.x). I didn't have enough time to upgrade Laravel and refactor the code.
5. Please go to the master branch to see the code
